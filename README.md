A fast, rule-based CLI tool for organizing files.

---

## üß≠ Introduction

**Tooka** is a flexible command-line tool for automating your filesystem: organize, rename, move, copy, or delete files using simple, powerful YAML rules.

You define what files to match (by name, extension, metadata, size, etc.) and what should happen to them ‚Äî Tooka handles the rest with blazing-fast parallel processing.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üéØ Rule-based automation** - Define custom file organization rules using declarative YAML
* **‚ö° High-performance** - Parallel recursive directory traversal and file operations
* **üîç Flexible filtering** - Match files by name patterns, extensions, MIME types, size, metadata, and timestamps
* **üõ†Ô∏è Multiple actions** - Move, copy, rename, delete, or skip files based on conditions
* **üìù Template support** - Dynamic file naming with customizable templates
* **üîí Safe operations** - Dry-run mode and comprehensive logging for safety
* **üåê Cross-platform** - Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Tooka**:
   ```bash
   # From source
   cargo install --git https://github.com/tooka-org/tooka
   
   # Or download pre-built binaries from releases
   ```

2. **Initialize configuration**:
   ```bash
   tooka config init
   ```

3. **Add your first rule**:
   ```bash
   # Create a simple rule to organize images
   echo 'id: organize-images
   priority: 100
   enabled: true
   when:
     extensions: ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif"]
   then:
     - action: move
       destination: "~/Pictures/{{extension}}"' > image-rule.yaml
   
   tooka add image-rule.yaml
   ```

4. **Test with dry-run**:
   ```bash
   tooka sort --dry-run ~/Downloads
   ```

5. **Apply the rules**:
   ```bash
   tooka sort ~/Downloads
   ```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic File Organization

```yaml
# Organize downloads by file type
id: organize-downloads
priority: 100
enabled: true
when:
  extensions: ["pdf", "doc", "docx"]
then:
  - action: move
    destination: "~/Documents/{{filename}}"
```

### Size-based Filtering

```yaml
# Move large files to external storage
id: archive-large-files
priority: 200
enabled: true
when:
  size_kb:
    min: 102400  # Files larger than 100MB
then:
  - action: move
    destination: "/external/storage/{{filename}}"
```

### Date-based Organization

```yaml
# Organize photos by creation date
id: organize-photos-by-date
priority: 150
enabled: true
when:
  mime_type: "image/*"
  created_date:
    from: "2024-01-01"
    to: "2024-12-31"
then:
  - action: move
    destination: "~/Photos/{{created_year}}/{{created_month}}/{{filename}}"
```

## üéõÔ∏è Rule Structure

Rules are defined in YAML format with the following structure:

```yaml
id: unique-rule-identifier          # Required: Unique identifier
priority: 100                       # Required: Execution priority (higher = first)
enabled: true                       # Required: Enable/disable rule
when:                               # Required: Conditions to match files
  filename: "pattern.*"             # Optional: Regex pattern for filename
  extensions: ["jpg", "png"]        # Optional: File extensions
  path: "*/Downloads/*"             # Optional: Path pattern
  size_kb:                          # Optional: Size range in KB
    min: 1024
    max: 10240
  mime_type: "image/*"              # Optional: MIME type pattern
  created_date:                     # Optional: Creation date range
    from: "2024-01-01"
    to: "2024-12-31"
  modified_date:                    # Optional: Modification date range
    from: "2024-01-01"
    to: "2024-12-31"
  is_symlink: false                 # Optional: Match symlinks
  metadata:                         # Optional: EXIF/metadata fields
    - key: "Camera"
      value: "Canon*"
  any: false                        # Optional: Use OR logic instead of AND
then:                               # Required: Actions to perform
  - action: move                    # Action type: move, copy, rename, delete, skip
    destination: "~/target/{{filename}}"  # Destination with template support
```

## üìù Template Variables

Tooka supports dynamic templates for file destinations:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{filename}}` | Full filename with extension | `document.pdf` |
| `{{name}}` | Filename without extension | `document` |
| `{{extension}}` | File extension | `pdf` |
| `{{size}}` | File size in bytes | `1024` |
| `{{created_year}}` | Creation year | `2024` |
| `{{created_month}}` | Creation month | `03` |
| `{{created_day}}` | Creation day | `15` |
| `{{modified_year}}` | Modification year | `2024` |
| `{{modified_month}}` | Modification month | `03` |
| `{{modified_day}}` | Modification day | `15` |

## ‚ö° Performance

Tooka is designed for speed and efficiency:

- **Parallel processing** using Rust's rayon for concurrent file operations
- **Optimized traversal** with priority-sorted rules for early termination
- **Memory efficient** streaming operations for large directories
- **Benchmarked performance** with Criterion.rs in `benches/` directory

Example benchmark results (sorting 1000 files):
- File collection: ~1.2ms
- Rule matching: ~5.5ms
- Total operation: ~12ms

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Dry-run mode** (`--dry-run`) to preview operations
- **Comprehensive logging** with multiple verbosity levels
- **Validation** of rules before execution
- **Error handling** with detailed error messages
- **Backup recommendations** before bulk operations
