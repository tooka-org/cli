## ðŸ§© Additional Considerations

* **Testing**: Utilize Go's built-in `testing` package for unit tests.
* **Configuration Management**: Store user configurations in a YAML file within the user's home directory, using `os.UserHomeDir()` to determine the path.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure that all file paths and operations are compatible with both Windows and Linux by using Go's `filepath` package.
